The General concept behind this project is to create an ocean and night sky in the general Synthwave style and have it react to the facial expression of the user. This is done in an attempt to visually represent the 'Sea of emotions' that humans feel

Features

A mesh ocean  that is controlled in these aspects by the height of the user's eyebrow;

- Wave Height (the max peak and min trough that the waves experience)

- Wave Reach  (How far the waves move forward and backward along the x-axis)

A night sky composed of;

- 'Stars' that twinkle in the sky

- A blood red moon that is replaced by the skull when a face is present

The floating skull is reactive in these aspects;

- The color of the wireframe (blood red, cyan, lime yellow)[reactive to the position of the user's eyebrows]

- The orientation of the skull [reactive to the orientation of the user's face]

- The scale of the skull [reactive to how open the user's mouth is]
